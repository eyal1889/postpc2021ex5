answer to q1:
the description is textView right now, so it wont be changed, but if i define it as EditText in
the xml, the user may change it. it will be very easy for him to find it (because its natural to 
edit a text by clicking it) and therfore its consistent to the android world 
and wont be hard to implement. (I wont need to change implemented things)
